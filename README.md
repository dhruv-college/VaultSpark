# VaultSpark

**VaultSpark** is a unified, AI-powered DeFi vault system built on the BlockDAG testnet. It enables secure lending/borrowing, NFT-based user rewards, and real-time analytics â€” all within an intuitive interface powered by MetaMask.

## Project Description

VaultSpark leverages the high throughput and parallel transaction capabilities of BlockDAG to offer:
- Instant multi-currency exchange
- Smart lending/borrowing with interest models
- NFT-based rewards for user actions
- Supabase-backed real-time analytics
- Seamless wallet connection via MetaMask

The frontend is optimized for performance using modern frameworks like **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and is fully open-source.
